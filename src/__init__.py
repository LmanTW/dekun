# Python is so stupid, why is this file even required???
# No idea why everybody just choose Python as the LLM's langauge, it's not like javascript is not that much harder.
# Even javascript (which is honest still not that great) is still way better than python, the syntax, the package manager, everything. It's jsut better.
